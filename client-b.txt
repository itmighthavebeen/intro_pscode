Task B: Find the Spot

 Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer.
 The customer can move north, south, east, or west. 
 
Mapping Application Version 1.0 

X (column)   Y (row)   item
0    		 0       front door
0    		 1       service desk
0    		 4       bathroom
-1   		 3       deli
-3   		 5       bakery
etc

Assumption: 1. given the table of location as x,y coordinates and item  found there
			2. Warehouse has labeled columns and rows that customer can use as reference 

Ask user "What item are you by now?"
Input answer from drop down of list of items and store x,y values as pointA(x,y)
Ask user "What item do you want to go to?"
Input answer from drop down of list of items and store x,y values as pointB(x,y)
calculate the north/south distance between pointA and pointB by subtracting pointB(y) - pointA(y) = north_south_value (a signed intgeger)
calculate the east/west distance between pointA and pointB by subtracting pointB(x) - pointA(x) = east_west_value (a signed integer)
Display answer to user of direction using these outcomes:
	If north_south_value is positive to user will go north that many rows
	If north_south_value is negative the user will go south that many rows
	If the east_west_value is positive the user will fo east that many columns
	If the east_west_value is negative the user will go west that many columns
	
Mapping Future Enhancements/deliverables so the client has met expectations
Version 1.1 - Give the user the choice to give you the item they are closest to OR the column / row number displayed nearby
Version 2.0 - Use geotracking API to determine coordinates such as Amazom Location Services
